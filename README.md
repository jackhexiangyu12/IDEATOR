### Basic Setup
1. Prepare the pretrained weights for MiniGPT-4 (Vicuna-13B v0)ï¼š
   Please refer to the guide from the MiniGPT-4 repository to get the weights of Vicuna. Then, set the path to the vicuna weight in the model config file [here](https://github.com/roywang021/IDEATOR/blob/main/minigpt4/configs/models/minigpt4.yaml#L16). Get MiniGPT-4 (the 13B version) checkpoint: download from here. Then, set the path to the pretrained checkpoint in the [minigpt4_eval.yaml](https://github.com/roywang021/IDEATOR/blob/main/minigpt4_eval.yaml#L11).
